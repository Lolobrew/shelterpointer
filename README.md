Shelter Pointer

A website that utilizes petfinder.com's api to allow users to search for pets in the area. Maps are provided through Google.

GOALS:

We eventually want to set up unique user pages through handlebars to allow the users to save the animals they like into a database.
We would like to have adoption forms automatically emailed to the shelter at which the user is applying for an adoption, or to register as a foster parent for an animal.
